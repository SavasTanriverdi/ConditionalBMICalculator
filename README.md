# ConditionalBMICalculator

This Java project calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) and provides health status feedback based on the BMI value. The project demonstrates the use of conditional statements (`if-else`) to categorize BMI results into different health statuses such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity.

## Key Features:
- Takes user's weight and height as input
- Calculates BMI using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))
- Uses conditional statements to classify the BMI value into different categories:
  - Underweight
  - Normal weight
  - Overweight
  - Obesity
- Displays both the BMI value and the health category

## Usage:
Run the main class and input your weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). The program will calculate your BMI and provide a corresponding health status.

## Technologies Used:
- Java
